    during compression.
    Hint: the built-in function 'bin' can be used: bin(n) - returns a 0-1 string corresponding to the binary representation
    of the number n. However the 0-1 string has a '0b' prefixed to it to indicate that it is binary, so you will have to 
    discard the first two chars of the string returned.
